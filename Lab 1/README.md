### The Report

### Part 1A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**

- Setting: bedroom, at night.
- Players: A single person. (If the bed is shared, the device can only be accessed by its owner.)
- Activity: The smartwatch the user wears detects his/hers progress in sleeping, and automatically adjusts the brightness of the nightlight.
- Goals: This device is ideal for people who are afraid of the dark while sleeping, ensuring that the nightlight is always on when the person is conscious and reducing the impact of light when the person is sleeping.

**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

**Summarize feedback you got here.**

My group was mainly focusing on setting up the Tinkerbelle app during class time, so I did not give or receive feedback on my storyboard. However, my actor finds my storyboard clear and easy to follow.

### Part 1B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

Tinkerbelle does not allow remote control of the device’s brightness. However, by changing the background color of the website, I achieved the effect desired.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

By experimenting with Tinkerbelle, I realized that it is not a tool of lighting, but colors, and have adjusted my implementations accordingly.

### Part 1C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**

Tinkerbelle is not a tool of lighting, but colors. (Lighting is about the duality between light and darkness and the spectrum in between. It is also about the giving and receiving of attention – the source of light is the perfect spot for hiding. Etc. Explorations in these directions cannot be implemented using Tinkerbelle.) 

### Part 1D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

**Show the follow-up work here.**

I first attempted to use my phone as the stand-in, but the brightness was not satisfactory. I achieved the desired effect by using my iPad as the stand-in device. It has a bigger screen so the brightness change became more obvious on the screen.

### Part 1E. Costume the device

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

**What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

My design decision is made based on a pursuit of safety, functionality, and flexibility. 

### Part 1F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

## Staging Interaction, Part 2

### Prep
**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**

"This was fantastic Jiaqi. The storyboards were very clear and it was easy to see the setting that this was meant to be used in.  In a future iteration I would suggest iterating on how the actor would use it in real life. It looked like it was flashing light in someone's eyes until they fell asleep (or heart rate fell) which may not be the most effective." -- Trevor Morcott

"I thought the videos were done really well. The ideas were shown well, it was a practical solution, and it is clear how this idea would work in the real world. Good job!" -- James Donnelly

Summary: Both of the feedback I got from my classmates indicated that my design and implementation were clear, and the device would be a practical solution to a real-world problem. The suggestion Trevor mentioned is, for me, more of a personal preference/target user issue. People have different sleep habits and different fears. My device is specifically designed for people who are afraid of the dark and can only fall asleep when there is a light turned on in the room. Those who are afraid of light and need to draw thick curtains to block out ambient light while they sleep may not be a good fit for this product. But I will keep this in mind when I design this week's interaction and try to design a more universal solution for as many people as possible.

### The Report

### PART 2A. Plan

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**

- Goals: In traditional Chinese medicine, the doctor uses four diagnostic methods, 望(observe), 闻(listen), 问(ask), 切(feeling of the pulse), to achieve an accurate diagnosis of the patient's condition. When requiring long-distance consultation, all but the last methods can be achieved using video calls. This product aims to resolve this issue by delivering an exact replication of the patient's pulse to the doctor's fingertips.
- Setting: Remote medical consultation. The doctor and the patients can be anywhere quiet and without disturbance. They should be able to communicate via video call.
- Players: Doctor and patient.
- Activity: During the session, the doctor will ask the patient to place a sensor on one of his/her wrists. The doctor, in turn, will place his/her fingertips on the reception pad. The pad is equipped with a sensor for pressure so that it can transfer the amount of pressure received from the doctor's fingertips to the patient's wrist. The pad has a display that can showcase different shades of blue. The hue of the color corresponds to the amount of pressure applied to the patient -- so that the doctor can confirm the accuracy of the transfer. The sensor will then detect the vibration (aka the pulse of the patient) and transfer it back to the reception pad on the doctor's end. 

**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

**Summarize feedback you got here.**
The actor understands the concept as well as the implementation.

### Part 2B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

The switch of shooting angles between the doctor and patient is easy on paper but requires planning and editing before and after acting.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

It occurred to me that I can finish shooting the shots of one character first before switching to the other and use editing to match them up.

### Part 2C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**

I mentioned in part 1 that Tinkerbelle is not a tool of lighting, but colors. So when I brainstormed for part 2, I kept this in mind and use it as a tool of colors instead.

### Part 2D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

Watch my set-up video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Xwb77YtYimzJztHUg_uXEAlWhDCQDUC/view?usp=sharing) !

**Show the follow-up work here.**

With the prior week's experience of working with Tinkerbelle, everything worked well with wizarding the device.

### Part 2E. Costume the device

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

![Costume](https://github.com/jackiejiaqiliu/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/IDD%20Lab%201%20Part%202%20-%20costume%20the%20device.jpeg)

**What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

I had a very clear and specific image of what this device looked like in my mind since the brainstorming stage, so I did not attempt to costume it in any other way. The height and the stability of the device are concerns when costuming my phone. A pillow is put under the phone to replicate the in-person pulse diagnosis.

### Part 2F. Record
