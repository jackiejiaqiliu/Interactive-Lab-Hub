I did not collaborate with anyone.

## Prep

1. ### Set up your Lab 2 Github

2. ### Get Kit and Inventory Parts

   Please find my inventory list [here](https://github.com/jackiejiaqiliu/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%202/partslist.md).

3. ### Prepare your Pi for lab this week


## Overview

A) [Connect to your Pi](#part-a)

## Part E.
### Modify the barebones clock to make it your own

My clock divides the minutes and hours of a day into boxes and rows on a canvas (each row represents an hour, each box in the row represents a minute). The boxes will show up one by one each minute. They are filled with different shades of blues, creating an overall gradient image that presents the progress of the day from dawn till dusk. The user can press the bottom button on the Adafruit MiniPiTFT at any point during the day, and a heart-warming message corresponding to the current time will greet the user, along with a digital clock that shows the exact time.

## Part F. 
### Make a short video of your modified barebones PiClock

## Part G. 
### Sketch and brainstorm further interactions and features you would like for your clock for Part 2.

Add a personalized feature that allows the user to change the gradient color:

By default, the gradient color will be determined by the current season (green - spring, red - summer, orange - fall, winter - blue).

However, if the user feels like the weather on that day feels like another season (for example, a very cold day in the fall that feels like winter), they can presses the top button on miniPiTFT, and change it to the color that fits their current feeling.

# Prep for Part 2

Feedback:

"Jackieâ€™s idea is brilliant with gradient and four colors with seasons. I really like her idea of counting time and fill up her background with grids. It is also cool with the implementation of a reminder of the time during the day. Her sketch is pretty clear as well, with all her thoughts and motivation included. I feel like the purpose of this clock and keep up with good works!" -- Hongjiao Heather Zhang

"I really like the different shades of color idea, and I think you should definitely execute the different colors for part 2. Meanwhile, maybe think about other possible interactions users can do. Maybe use the other button or some other extensions?" -- Shuyuan Sylvia Ding
